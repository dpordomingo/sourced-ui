## Changelog

This project lists the important changes between releases in the
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file.

If you open a PR, you should also add a brief summary in the `CHANGELOG.md`
mentioning the new feature, change or bugfix that you proposed.


## Work With Superset Upstream

Superset version which we are based on is defined in `Makefile`.

To see which files are patched compare to upstream, run:

```shell
$ make diff-stat
```

To see diff with upstream, run:

```shell
$ make diff
```


## Build Docker Image

The official Docker images of sourced-ui, used by **source{d} CE** are released at
[hub.docker.com/r/srcd/sourced-ui](https://hub.docker.com/r/srcd/sourced-ui). You
can also build yours running:

```shell
$ make build
```

The docker image name and tag are defined by the [`Makefile`](Makefile) and can
be overridden passing environment variables to the `build` target, example:

```shell
$ DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME=my/sourced-ui VERSION=local make build
```

will locally build an image called `my/sourced-ui:local`

## Run source{d} CE For Development With Hot Reloading

Running **source{d} CE** in development mode will enable hot reloading at
http://127.0.0.1:8088, so every change you perform in `srcd` or `superset`
directories will trigger a refresh in your browser with the new code.

1. Install the latest version of [**source{d} CE**](https://github.com/src-d/sourced-ce/releases)
(see [installation guide](https://docs.sourced.tech/community-edition/quickstart/2-install-sourced)
if needed)

1. Build the `srcd/sourced-ui:latest-dev` development image, with the sources of `sourced-ui`:

    ```shell
    $ make build-dev
    ```

    It will take some time to be ready (~5min).

1. Run the watcher.

    <details>
        <summary><b>IMPORTANT note:</b> Requirements for the watcher</summary>

    The watcher requires either [`inotify-tools`](https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/wiki)
    (for Linux), or [`fswatch`](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch)
    (for Linux and MacOS)

    - To install `inotify-tools`
        - in Ubuntu you can run:
            ```shell
            $ sudo apt-get install inotify-tools
            ```

    - To install `fswatch`:
        - in MacOS, you can [use brew to install `fswatch`](https://brewinstall.org/install-fswatch-on-mac-with-brew):
            ```shell
            $ brew install fswatch
            ```
        - in Ubuntu you can build and install [from `fswatch` sources](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch):
            ```shell
            $ ./autogen.sh
            $ ./configure
            $ make
            $ sudo make install
            $ sudo ldconfig
            ```
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><b>ALTERNATIVE:</b> If you can not use any watcher</summary>

    - If you cannot use any of these watchers, you can just run this:

        ```shell
        $ make set-override # to prepare the environment
        $ make patch # needed EVERYTIME you change something in `srcd`
        $ make clean # once you finish, to clean up everything.
        ```
    </details>

    To watch for changes in `srcd` directory, run the local watcher in one tab,
    from your local `sourced-ui` root directory:

    ```shell
    $ make dev-prepare
    ```

    You can stop it pressing `Ctrl+C`. Once you do it, the patch will be
    automatically cleaned.

1. Run `sourced` as usually (see [execution guide](https://docs.sourced.tech/community-edition/quickstart/3-init-sourced)
    if needed):

    ```shell
    # for repositories from GitHub organizations
    $ sourced init orgs <orgs...> --token=<token>

    # or, for repositories stored locally
    $ sourced init local </path/to/repos>
    ```

    The first time you launch it, it will take some time to build all the UI assets,
    you can see the progress of the build from `sourced-ui` logs (see next step).

    It may happen that the hot reloading stops working with an error message
    `Failed to compile` that cannot be solved modifying the source code.
    It usually happens when switching between branches or stopping the watcher.
    To fix it, you only need to ensure the watcher is running, and `init` again.

1. To see `sourced-ui` logs (with `npm` errors and such), run:

    ```shell
    $ sourced logs -f sourced-ui
    ```

## Merging upstream

We base sourced-ui on release tags of superset instead of master.

### Revert release branch changes (optional)

Release branches might contain cherry-picks or other commits that aren't presented in master branch or the next release branch.
In such case it makes sense to revert them before applying changes from newer release.

All the releases have a topic in [mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@superset.apache.org) which contain common ancestor sha and list of commits for each release tag.

1. Find common ancestor in the mailing list
1. Find the last split commit
    ```
    $ git log | grep git-subtree-split
    ```
1. Checkout to split commit
1. Revert commits
    ```
    $ git revert --no-commit <common ancestor sha>...<release tag>
    ```
1. Commit the revert as single commit
    ```
    $ git commit -s -m "revert to upstream master from <release tag>"
    ```
1. Merge revert into sourced-ui tree
    ```
    $ git co master
    $ git subtree merge -P superset HEAD@{1} --squash
    ```

### Merge new release

```
$ git subtree merge -P superset <release-tag> --squash
```

### After merge checklist

- Re-create venv and re-install dependencies
- Run linters
    ```
    $ make patch
    $ cd superset
    $ tox -e black
    $ tox -e flake8
    $ tox -e pylint
    ```
- Merge migrations (if needed)
    ```
    $ pip install -e .
    $ superset db heads
    $ superset db merge <head1> <head2>
    ```
- Run tests
    ```
    $ docker run --rm -p 6379:6379 redis
    $ tox -e py36-sqlite
    ```
- Check (and ported if needed) config files:
  - `superset/contib/docker`
  - `superset/superset/config.py`
  - `superset/.travis.yml`
- Update `Makefile` with the new `SUPERSET_VERSION`
- Test the upgrade building & checking it with `src-d/sourced-ce`
    ```
    $ make build
    # it will build `srcd/sourced-ui:latest`
    $ sourced init local .
    $ cd ~/.sourced/workdirs/__active__
    $ docker-compose images sourced-ui
    # confirm that it uses the `srcd/sourced-ui:latest` image that you just built
    ```
